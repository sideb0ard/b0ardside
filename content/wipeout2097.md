Found this vid via a recent <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2024/06/recent-movies-and-tv-26/">JWZ blogpost</a> - super good wee 30 min documentary about the sound design behind Wipeout 2097, a game that came out with the european release of the PlayStation in 1996, done by UK game design studio Psygnosis. And graphic design by Designers Republic! I didn't know they had worked on games (they're very well known in music circles for many Warp records covers) - Awesome!
