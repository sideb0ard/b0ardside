Hmm, my <a href="https://github.com/sideb0ard/SBShell/blob/master/granulator.c">granular synth</a> hasn't quite come together yet, but I'm learning a load.

This is a pretty informative (promo) video from Robert Henke/Monolake showcasing his <a href='https://www.ableton.com/en/packs/granulator-ii/'>'Granulator' plugin for Ableton Live.</a>

If i can get mine to sound anything like that i'll be stoked!
