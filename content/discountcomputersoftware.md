I've been a big fan of <a href="https://evel.bandcamp.com/">Evel</a> records out of spain for a few years - tons of great releases from artists I love such as William Fields, Deli Kuvveti, NOXIN, Guy Birkin, and many more. So I was super stoked when they approached me last year about putting out a release!

It dropped on a friday, a split release with an amazing Spanish artist named AmorObsoleto!
