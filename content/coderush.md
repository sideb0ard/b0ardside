I was revisiting the <a href="https://www.internethistorypodcast.com/2017/07/don-melton-on-apple-safari-webkit-and-netscape/">Don Melton episode of Internet History podcast</a> and heard them mention 'Code Rush' - I kinda vaguely remember watching this years ago, but quite nutty to revisit now. It's such a crazy time-capsule, covering the tail end of the Browser wars, as Netscape rush to meet their own deadline to release the source code of Netscape Communicator, and the formation of Mozilla.org.

Riveting!
