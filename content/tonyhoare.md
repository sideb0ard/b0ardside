I'm currently reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Communicating-Sequential-Processes-International-Computing/dp/0131532715/ref=sr_1_fkmr2_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1419057192&sr=8-1-fkmr2">Tony Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes</a> - it's awesome! I searched to see if I could find some youtube videos of him - this one is brilliant, him talking about what should be taught in Computer Science, the universal ideas of logic and geometry unpinning computation, going back to Euclid and Artistotle. Great stuff!
