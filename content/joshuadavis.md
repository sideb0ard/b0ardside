[Tack](https://twitter.com/tackyy) turned me onto this guy the other day - i love him! Artist/Skater/Hacker - whats not to love?! 


This was following me and Tack's [Codetraxx](https://github.com/sideb0ard/Codetraxx) project - which is working - we're making music and synchronized via RabbitMQ as we set out to do - however we've hit a bit of a wall with the algorithmic math behind musical composition, so we've decided to focus on some mathematical hack nights for a while. Another friend of mine, [Matt Spendlove](https://twitter.com/mattspendlove), had told me about [The Nature Of Code](http://natureofcode.com/book/) which i've been wanting to read, so I suggested we play with Processing - seems awesome already! So yeah, Codetraxx on hold for a while, and work on a couple of Processing projects for a while ...
