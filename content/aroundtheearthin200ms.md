<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8144/7130704573_e6954f496e_z.jpg" alt="" /></p><p>A month or two back, i saw an interesting figure on Bram Cohen's blog:</p><p>&#8220;The speed of light in a fiber optic cable around the earth&rsquo;s circumference is about 200 milliseconds.&#8221;<br />(from <a href="http://bramcohen.com/2012/05/04/engineering-ip-telephony" title="Bram Cohen" target="_blank">here</a>)</p><p>I clipped it for my ever expanding Evernote tech tips, thinking it's one of those useful metrics to know. I've referred to it a few times now, but I always like to verify things myself, so this morning I looked up the relevant data -</p><p>So - speed of light in a vacuum is 186,000 miles per second. However according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber#Index_of_refraction" title="optical fiber on wikipedia" target="_blank">this wikipedia article</a>, the index of refraction for the cladding of an optical fiber is 1.52. &#8220;From this information, a good rule of thumb is that signal using optical fiber for communication will travel at around 200 million meters per second&#8221;. </p><p>Ok, so 200, 000,000 meters / second = 200, 000 meters / ms</p><p>&#8220;The circumference of the earth at the equator is 24,901.55 miles (40,075.16 kilometers).&#8221; // from <a href="http://geography.about.com/library/faq/blqzcircumference.htm" title="earth circumerfence" target="_blank">here</a></p><p>40,075.15km = 40,075,000 meters</p><p><strong>With all figures then, Earth Circumference is 40,075,000 meters, and the speed of light in fiber is 200,000 meters per ms:<br />40,075,000 /2 00,000 = 200.375 ms</strong></p><p>// or to be even smarter, I could have just followed the Wolfram Alpha link from Bram's blog <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=circumference+of+the+earth+%2F+speed+of+light+in+glass" title="Wolfram Alpha" target="_blank">here</a> - gotta love the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram" title="Stephen Wolfram" target="_blank">Wolfram</a> // </p>
