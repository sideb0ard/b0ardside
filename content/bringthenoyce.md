<p>yow, sorry, that title's a really bad pun! </p><p><iframe width="590" height="443" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/AfxUq_QrpyY?fs=1&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>So two things here - i started to watch this video with Robert Noyce talking about the development of the IC, but in the introduction and in his opening, they talk about an article written by Tom Wolfe about Noyce - now, Tom Wolfe was a massive influence on my teenage self, or at least one of his books, The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test, which a friends older brother passed on to me when i was fifteen. Apart from being an excellent writer, the book, as I'm sure most know, was about Ken Kesey and The Merry Pranksters, and the birth of acid culture. Wolfe's way with words is incredible, and the mythologizing he manages to paint is deliciously enjoyable. He applies the same magic to telling the story of Robert Noyce in <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/e140/e140a/content/noyce.html" title="Wolfe on Noyce" target="_blank">this truly amazing article from Esquire magazine, written in 1984</a>. Well worth an hour of your time to read the article - i had no idea how much he had influenced the whole culture of Silicon Valley.</p>
