<p>Just got back from the Usenix/Lisa 12 conference in San Diego, and had a great time, super inspiring talks and content.</p><p>Highlight of the conference for me was Brendan Gregg speaking on Performance Analysis Methodologies - most of his talk was based upon a paper he just published in ACM - <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2413037" title="ACM" target="_blank">Thinking Methodically About Performance</a>.</p><p>The talks haven't yet been published on the Usenix website, but Brendan's blog has a ton of great looking content and older talks including this one on Visualisations for Performance Analysis</p><p><iframe width="590" height="332" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ml-t-9g6Mjc?fs=1&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
