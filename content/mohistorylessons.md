I've been genning up on node.js, which has led me into studying more javascript, and this latest lecture, is a massive five part series of talks about javascript. It's the first one which really stands out, and which fits in with the theme of historical lectures i've been posting, covering the history of computing from the Jacquard Loom through the evolution of processors and programming languages up to Javascript. Check them all online <a href="http://www.yuiblog.com/crockford/" title="Douglas Crockford">here</a></p><p>[[image by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/equanimity/4366716421/sizes/m/in/photostream/" title="equanimity">equanimity</a>]]</p>
