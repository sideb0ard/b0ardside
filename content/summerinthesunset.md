Very excited to be taking part in a group art show at an amazing little gallery here in the Sunset, called <a href="https://sealevelsf.com/">Sealevel</a>.
Two of us B0ardsiders will be represented, myself and <a href="http://brentwillson.com/">Brent Willson</a>.

I dropped off pieces yesterday and spoke with Jeana that runs it. We're going to do an interview with her about the gallery for an upcoming issue of the zine! Stay tuned.

Opening celebration will be next saturday, July 15th, from 1-5pm. If you're local, come by and check out the art! The show will be running until the end of September. If you can't make the opening, do drop past and checkout the gallery. I'll be manning the gallery desk on Sunday, July 16th, so i'll be there all weekend!
