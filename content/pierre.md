This is an awesome documentary by local fella, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/avenue_films/">Pete Koff</a>, which I had the pleasure of seeing last year at a local showing at the Great Highway Gallery. Pete has contributed a great wee story about skating in Pacifica in the 80s, for our upcoming issue #5 of the B0ardside (mark yer calendar - next backyard show will be June 17th - will have art installation by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/anthony.r.grant/">Anthony R Grant</a>, and music by <a href="https://neutrals.bandcamp.com/">Neutrals</a> and <a href="https://codame.com/artists/jules-litman-cleper">Shatter Pattern</a> - more details to come!)

Pierre is a local neighborhood character, who cycles past my door almost daily. He has amazingly rich history as chronicled here!
