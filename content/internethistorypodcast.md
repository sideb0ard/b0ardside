I've been re-living the dream of the 90's recently, by spending a lot of time listening to this excellent <a href="https://www.internethistorypodcast.com/">Internet History podcast</a> -

The <a href="https://www.internethistorypodcast.com/">site</a> has a full list of all episodes, which you can find on pretty much any podcast app. In particular I enjoyed the conversations with most of the early Netscape engineers, such as Lou Montulli, Chris Wilson, Jon Mittelhauser, Aleks Totic, plus the several episodes discussing the birth of Wired magazine, Suck.com and early online culture!
