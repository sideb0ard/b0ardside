I just read this pretty awesome book <a href="http://weheardyoulikebooks.com/releases/i-hate-the-internet/">'I Hate The Internet' by Jarett Kobek</a>. It has a nice cynical irreverence, but very astute awareness of the power of modern social networks.

Coincidentally, I just came across this decent talk from Joel Spolsky, which if you kinda squint a little, sorta touches upon a few similar subjects as in 'I Hate The Internet', at least in that there a lot of assumptions and decisions baked into the algorithms in modern software, a lot of hidden power structures and bias. The talk goes off in a different direction towards the end, but definitely worth watching. 

The book is brilliant too. Check it.
