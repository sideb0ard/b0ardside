I'm moving into a new job position soon involving way more code, working in C/C++. I've just started watching this podcast series and it's excellent - this one in particular is super relevant, bringing one of the best features from Golang into C. I like the minimalism of the project, it seems very much in alignment with the philosophy behind <a href="//suckless.org">Suckless</a>. (There's a previous episode, speaking with Anselm R Garbe from suckless, i'd also highly recommend..)
