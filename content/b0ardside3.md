Hey lovelies!

We're hosting another awesome weekend of live music and art in our Backyard space next weekend, June 19th/20th.

We have an amazing body of work by <A href="http://www.creationsofentropy.com/">Entropy</a>, a good friend of ours, and local Sunset artist.

On saturday, we'll have a live opera performance and talk by CÃ©line Ricci. She is the Founder /Executive Artistic Director from <a href="https://www.arsminerva.org/">Ars Minerva</a>, and live music from <a href="http://www.totalshutdown.com/murdermurder3.html">Murder Murder</a>

Sunday we'll have live music by <a href="https://tim-and-donna-lunchbox.bandcamp.com/album/after-school-special">Lunchbox</a>!
