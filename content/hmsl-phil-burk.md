I was out in London for 10 days recently, where I attended the JUCE Audio Developers Conference.
Some great talks! I particularly enjoyed this one by Phil Burk on HMSL - Hierarchical Music Specification Language - a language he was involved in designing a Mill College, here in the Bay Area from the mid eighties till the early nineties. I've asked Phil to present a simlilar talk at Algorithmic Art Assembly 2020, which he's agreed to!
