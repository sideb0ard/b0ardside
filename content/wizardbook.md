I've never made it very far through my copy of Abelson, Sussman and Sussman's 'Structure and Interpretation Of Computer Programs', so I was super excited to find this whole series of lectures online with Harold and Gerald Jay presenting the text as a course. The lectures help a lot, making it a whole lot easier than just wading through the text yourself. I went deep over the weekend, watching the first four of them - My Lisp foo is getting strong!
