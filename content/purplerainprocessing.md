I was listening to the <a href="http://creativecodingpodcast.com/61-coding-rainbows-with-dan-shiffman/">Creative Coding podcast</a> with Daniel Shiffman the other day - One thing they discussed was Daniel's new Coding Challenges youtube series - this one to do a 'Purple Rain' in Processing is really fun!
