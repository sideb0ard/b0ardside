My mother, over in Glasgow, was telling me about a BBC program called A Day In The Life, and specifically of an episode about Frank QUitely - i found it on youtube.com for about 30 mins but it's already been taken down. (I didn't get to see it either!!).

Fortunately however, I did find this lovely interview with "Frank" (whose name i just found out is a stage name! )
