Well then, well then!

Big changes afoot! This has been my personal blog for many years, just random videos I dig and the occasional content of my own.
The name 'B0ardside' was one I originally thought of as the name of a venue I would one day own. Well! That time is now.

With Covid going on, I decided to experiment with my backyard more for open-air shows, putting on my first show in early september, which went well.

Since then, and chatting with friends, <a href="https://www.gorney.studio/">Douglas Gorney</a> and <a href="http://brentwillson.com/">Brent Willson</a>, we've morphed the space into an art collective, with a zine and putting on more shows.

This weekend, we're going to put on a two day show featuring Brent's work. Zines will be available too. Come check it out!
