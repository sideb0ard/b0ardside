This is a good chat with Doug Eck, of the <a href="g.co/magenta">Google Magenta project</a>
It's a project I've been keeping an eye on, as it has a ton of potential. I've generated some melodies based on their <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta/tree/master/magenta/models/melody_rnn">Melody RNN</a> - although i need to spend more time with it, as I've been more focussed on own generative algorithms.
