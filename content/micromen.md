I bookmarked this to watch after [Hilary Mason](http://www.hilarymason.com/) tweeted it recently - i thought i had previously watched it but after seeing it tonite I realised i hadn't - super fun history, really taking me back to my youth! It tells the story of Sir Clive Sinclair and his rivalry with Acorn computers who produced the BBC Micro - the BBC Micro was the first machine I ever used, back in High School sometime in the mid 1980s, and the Sinclair ZX Spectrum was the first computer i owned. Read on MacDuff..
