Amazingly smooth presentation under time pressure from Karim Yaghmour, giving a super fast overview of the content in his <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021094.do">Embedded Android</a> book.

I've been deep in Android source code these past few weeks - I just moved from an Ops role to Embedded Developer - I've never read or written so much C code in my life - it's awesome!
