With our move to Puppet for config management, we also moved to using Apt packaging for our code deployment, tying them together with a line similar to :</p><p><code>class foo-export {<br />    package { &#039;foo-export&#039;: ensure => latest }<br />}</code></p><p>So that whenever we deploy a new version of a package to our apt-repo, it can then be installed with a:</p><p><code>puppet agent --test</code><br />(and with an initial dry-run using <code>--noop</code>)</p><p>( I should mention I manage our Puppet runs via our own distributed scripts, rather than having the nodes set up to check in every 30mins - when I'm doing so much work on our Puppet setup and config, I'd rather not having machines check in automatically in case the config is in a broken state )</p><p>Inevitably I would run the above Puppet command and it would not find any new packages, because &#8216;d'uh!', of course I still need to run an <code>apt-get update</code>.</p><p>I've been using Puppet stages for a while now, in order to group package installations in a broader sense rather than manually spelling out every dependency with a <code>require =></code> stanza, so it was a simple addition to add in a <code>pre</code> stage, and have the nodes run <code>apt-get update</code> before any runs.</p><p>In order to use stages, you need to first define them in your site.pp. By default every defined class runs under Stage[main], so you just need to add the new stages and define the running order. (full Puppet stage documentation is <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/language_guide.html" title="Puppet Stages" target="_blank">here</a>)</p><p>At the top of my site.pp file, I added a pre and post stage, then define the execution order via:</p><p><code>stage { [pre, post]: }<br />Stage[pre] -> Stage[main] -> Stage[post]</code></p><p>Then I created a class called apt-hupdate (sorry, i use stupid naming conventions!) in<br /><code>modules/apt-hupdate/manifests/init.pp</code></p><p>which contained:<br /><code>class apt-hupdate {</p><p>    exec { "aptHupdate":<br />        command => "/usr/bin/apt-get update",<br />    }<br />}</code></p><p>And finally, include that in your site.pp with:</p><p><code>class { apt-hupdate: stage => pre }</code></p><p>Now every time you do a Puppet run, <code>apt-get update</code> will be the first task run.</p>
